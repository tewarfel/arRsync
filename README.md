# arRsync
fork of arRsync from Sourceforge, originally by Miles Wu and Adam Watkins.

This helpful front-end GUI for the rsync utility  was released back in 2006 and compiled for 32-bit OSX systems.
After Mojave, OSX (now MacOS) no longer supports the 32-bit apps.

This repository is a fork of the source code from https://sourceforge.net/projects/arrsync/files/arrsync/0.4%20Bugfix%201/ 
with  my changes to get it to compile (albeit with a few deprecation warnings) under XCode 12.4 on MacOS Catalina.

Apart from this README file, these files are a copy of the original version 0.4.1 for OSX 10.4
